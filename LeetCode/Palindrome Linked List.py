Problem Name: Palindrome Linked List

Problem Section: Linked List

Problem Statement:
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: 1->2
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true

Follow up:
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

# Solution techniques are
# Time complexity : O(n) Space complexity : O(1) two pointer with reversing the second half of the linked list
