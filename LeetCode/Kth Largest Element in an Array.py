Problem Name: Kth Largest Element in an Array

Problem Section: Sorting and Searching

Problem Statement:
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example:
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.
