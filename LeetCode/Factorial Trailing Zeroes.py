Problem Name: Factorial Trailing Zeroes

Problem Section: Math

Problem Statement:
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Example 1:

Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.

Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

The ZERO comes from 10.
The 10 comes from 2 x 5
And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4Ã—5 = 20 ...
So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10
