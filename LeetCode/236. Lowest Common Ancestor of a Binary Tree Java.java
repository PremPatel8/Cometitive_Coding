/* Problem Name: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/solution/

Problem Section: 

Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Solution techniques are Iterative without parent pointers

/* 
Time Complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree. The advantage of this approach is that we can prune backtracking. We simply return once both the nodes are found.
Space Complexity : O(N). In the worst case the space utilized by stack would be N since the height of a skewed binary tree could be N.
